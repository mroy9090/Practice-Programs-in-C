# 🛠️ Practice Programs in C

This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate-level C programs written as part of practice and experimentation with various C programming concepts. It is useful for beginners looking to learn core programming logic and standard syntax in C.

## 📁 Contents

- `distance.c` – Calculates the distance between two points using coordinate geometry.
- `fibonacci_sorting.c` – Generates a Fibonacci sequence and demonstrates sorting algorithms.
- `file read and write.c` – Handles reading from and writing to text files.
- `file.c` – General file manipulation operations.
- `game.c` – Simple terminal-based game (likely a logic-based game like number guessing or Tic Tac Toe).
- `life.c` – Could be a personal simulation or a simple C-life logic project.
- `maximum and minimum fun.c` – Finds the maximum and minimum values in an array using functions.
- `multiplicaton_pointer.c` – Demonstrates multiplication operation using pointers.
- `palindrome string.c` – Checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
- `reverse string.c` – Reverses a string entered by the user.
- `sort_pointer.c` – Implements sorting using pointer manipulation.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

Make sure you have GCC installed. You can compile and run any file like this:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
